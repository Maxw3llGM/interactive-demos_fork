        The Digital Audio Workbench aims to provide an accessible interactive
        platform for intuitively exploring key concepts in digital signal
        processing.  Numerous modular graphs are available which can aid in
        teaching and studying issues such as aliasing, quantization,
        dither, upsampling, downsampling, oversampling, undersampling, and
        more.

    <p>
        Please follow the links below to explore different subsets of the
        displays implemented so far.  Note that so far we have only tested the
        project on recent Chromium-based browsers.  Furthermore, the display is
        not yet properly responsive for mobile devices and other small screens.
        If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to send us an
        email.
